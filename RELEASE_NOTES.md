### 2021a rev. 2

In `2021b` several time zones which were alike since 1970 were merged. It
received backlash in tz mailing-list. Please check
[September archive](https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2021-September/thread.html)
for discussions around the merges.

This contains a subset of the updates from IANA's 2021b update, but not all
because they cause problems for various libraries and OSes, Android included.
New links cause problems for the tzlookup.xml generation process, which have
yet to be resolved. Android API behavior is influenced by ICU, so while ICU
are forked and until things become clearer, so is Android.

ICU decided to skip zone merge changes and named their release `2021a1`.
Unfortunately there are hardcoded places in Android which expect tzdb version
to be exactly 5 characters and we release it as `2021a rev. 2`.

`input_data/iana/tzdata2021a.tar.gz` is renamed ICU's `2021a1.tar.gz`. As it
is not signed, `tzdata2021a.tar.gz.asc` was deleted for this release only.

`2021a1` contains the following changes applied on top of `2021a`:

```

These changes are in chronological order -- from old to new, so apply them
accordingly.

"Replace Pacific/Enderbury with Pacific/Kanton" change was skipped as it
requires changes in CLDR and `tzdb2021b` was announced late in CLDR's release
cycle.

Code changes were skipped as Android uses fixed version of tzcode, not ToT.
